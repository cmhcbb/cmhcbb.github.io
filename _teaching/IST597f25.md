## Description
This is an intensive graduate seminar on Trustworthy machine learning. The course covers different topics in emerging research areas related to the broader study of security and privacy in machine learning. Students will learn about attacks against computer systems leveraging machine learning, as well as defense techniques to mitigate such attacks.

## Prerequisites
The course assumes students already have some basic understanding of machine learning. Students will familiarize themselves with the emerging body of literature from different research communities investigating security&privacy questions in machine learning. The class is designed to help students explore new research directions and applications. Most of the course readings will come from both seminal and recent papers in the field. 

## Grading Policy
Grades will be computed based on the following factors:
- Paper presentation (30%)
- Paper summaries (10%)
- Class notes & participation (10%)
- Research project (50%)

Final grade cutoff:
- A [93%, 100%]
- A- [90%, 93%)
- B+ [87%, 90%)
- B [83%, 87%)
- B- [80%, 83%)
- C+ [77%, 80%)
- C [70%, 77%)
- D [60%, 70%)
- F [0%, 60%)

## Assignments
- **Reading summary:**
A 1 page summary of reading assigned is due each class (starting from week 2 and onwards). A physical copy should be turned in before the beginning of class. The summary should cover the following: (a) what did the papers do well?, (b) where did the papers fall short?, (c) what did you learn from these papers?, and (d) what questions do you have about the papers?
- **Paper presentation:**
starting from week 2, each student will present the papers assigned for reading each week. The student may choose an appropriate format (e.g., slides, interactive demos or code tutorials, ...) for this presentation with the only requirements being that the presentation should (a) involve the class in active discussions, (b) cover all papers assigned for reading, and (c) last no more than 1h including discussions.
- **Class notes:**
Another team of students will be charged with writing notes synthesizing the content of the presentation and class discussion.

## Research Projects
Students are required to do a project in this class. The goal of the course project is to provide the students an opportunity to explore research directions in trustworthy machine learning. The project should be related to the course content. An expected project consists of

- A novel and sound solution to an interesting problem
- Comprehensive literature review and discussion
- Thorough theoretical/experimental evaluation and comparisons with existing approaches

## Late Submission Policy
- All reports are due on Thursday at 11:59 pm (EST).
- Students can submit late with the penalty of 25% deduction for every 12 hours late (up to 2 days).
- After 2 days, no more late submission is allowed.
- Extensions can be granted for special cases (email the instructor)
